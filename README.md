# SoftwareQA-Assignment02
Repository that contains all source code for assignment 2.

Assumptions: Operating system is Windows 10, the files are stored on the user desktop.

Begin by downloading Python 3.6x or newer by opening cmd and writing ‘python’, if you already have Python installed, skip this step.

Then, download the cmdapp.py and test_cmdapp.py files from my GitHub Directory linked here: https://github.com/bkimball98/SoftwareQA-Assignment02. 

Open cmdapp.py with a text editor or IDE and delete the ‘#’ character before the call to main() at the bottom of the file. Save cmdapp.py and close it.

Move the two Python files into your desktop folder, then open cmd by typing cmd into the Windows ‘search’ bar and pressing enter. 

Use the command ‘cd Desktop’ to navigate to the desktop where the Python files reside. 

Then, use the command ‘python cmdapp.py’ to run the cmdapp. To run the test code, write ‘python test_cmdapp.py’.  It will bring up the cmdapp.py interface first, so you must use the third option (enter ‘3’) to skip it. Then the tests will run.
